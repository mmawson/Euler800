Project Euler Problem 800
An integer of the form p^q*q^p with prime numbers p not equal to q is called a hybrid-integer.
Let C(n) be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to n.
What is C(800800^800800)?

This program searches through a two arrays of prime numbers using binary search to find C(800800^800800)
Results are written in a .csv file (800800Result.csv)
Sum the second column of the csv to get the answer
